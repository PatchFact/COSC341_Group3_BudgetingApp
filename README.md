# COSC 341 Group 3 - Budgeting App

## TODO:
- [ ] Dashboard - Rev
- [ ] Envelopes - Brock
- [ ] Acccounts - Erfan
- [ ] Transactions - Esteban
- [ ] Reports - Rommel

## XML Struture
- Transactions {TransactionId (PK), EnvelopeId, Date, Note, Account, Amount} EnvelopeId is FK to Envelopes
- Envelopes {EnvelopeId (PK), Budget, Name}

## Further Evaluation
- Meyz:
-   - Add share/export pdf of reports
    - On Envelopes page, textview positions need to adjust.
    - On the Account page, change the buttons so that users can understand that they will
- Mahid
    - Add more details for the quick add button so that users understand what the button is for
    - On the transactions page, add a sort button based on different factors
- Sana:
    - On the new transactions, for the date, the drop-down menu is easier for the user
    - On the account page, there is no need for the show all button; the app can show all the transactions in a simple window with a scroll bar.
